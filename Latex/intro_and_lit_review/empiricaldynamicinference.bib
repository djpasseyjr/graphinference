abstract={Many research questions in Earth and environmental sciences are inherently causal, requiring robust analyses to establish whether and how changes in one variable cause changes in another. Causal inference provides the theoretical foundations to use data and qualitative domain knowledge to quantitatively answer these questions, complementing statistics and machine learning techniques. However, there is still a broad language gap between the methodological and domain science communities. In this Technical Review, we explain the use of causal inference frameworks with a focus on the challenges of time series data. Domain-adapted explanations, method guidance and practical case studies provide an accessible summary of methods for causal discovery and causal effect estimation. Examples from climate and biogeosciences illustrate typical challenges, such as contemporaneous causation, hidden confounding and non-stationarity, and some strategies to address these challenges. Integrating causal thinking into data-driven science will facilitate process understanding and more robust machine learning and statistical models for Earth and environmental sciences, enabling the tackling of many open problems with relevant environmental, economic and societal implications.},

    abstract = {Abstract Ecosystems are complex and sparsely observed making inference and prediction challenging. Empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) circumvents the need for a parametric model and complete observations of all system variables. Classical univariate approaches, which require time-series observations of only a single focal variable, can produce verifiable out-of-sample forecasts; however, they can sometimes require long time series that may be difficult to obtain. More importantly, classical approaches limit the depth of mechanistic understanding that can be gained and the generalizability of forecasts to non-analogue futures. We review the main ideas of EDM and more recent extensions that expand their capabilities for improving forecasts and understanding mechanism. Algorithms are now available that allow for missing data, unequal sampling intervals and combining short time series, which increase the number of datasets that can be used. Recent extensions of EDM to multivariate time series substantially expand the range of applications and mechanistic questions that can be addressed, including detecting causal coupling, tracking changing interactions in real time, leveraging short time series from information shared in coupled variables, modelling dynamically changing stability, scenario exploration, and management applications involving optimal control.},

@article{huynhthu2018dynenie3,
	abstract = {The elucidation of gene regulatory networks is one of the major challenges of systems biology. Measurements about genes that are exploited by network inference methods are typically available either in the form of steady-state expression vectors or time series expression data. In our previous work, we proposed the GENIE3 method that exploits variable importance scores derived from Random forests to identify the regulators of each target gene. This method provided state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, but it could however not specifically be applied to time series expression data. We propose here an adaptation of the GENIE3 method, called dynamical GENIE3 (dynGENIE3), for handling both time series and steady-state expression data. The proposed method is evaluated extensively on the artificial DREAM4 benchmarks and on three real time series expression datasets. Although dynGENIE3 does not systematically yield the best performance on each and every network, it is competitive with diverse methods from the literature, while preserving the main advantages of GENIE3 in terms of scalability.},
