# `graphinference`

Infering computational networks from time series data.

## Install
This package requires Java because some of the network inference methods call algorithms written in Java. You can install or update Java
from the [Java website](https://www.java.com/).


Once you know Java is installed. Clone the repo, and from the top level, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
